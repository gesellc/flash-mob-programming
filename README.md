# Flash Mob Programming - Trust First

A mob programming format, aimed towards creating trust quickly in newly formed mobs.

We do this by coming together applying very strict rules for a short time. If these rules do their job, they create structure and space to actively listen, practice empathy and getting to know each other. Having acted out this explicit marker of trust we then free ourselves from these rules, iterating and improving as a team, enjoying the ride in pursuit of flow.

While in the beginning only the navigator speaks or initiates conversation, you might then decide to iterate towards Woody Zuill's ideal of everybody contributing the right thing, at the right time, in the right way.

# Guiding Questions

Can a small set of rules help a newly formed mob to build trust quickly?

Can the same mob then transition to more relaxed mobbing practices, improving flow of progress and learning?

Can we do this within a short session?

Can we do this with a large number of mobs?


# Session Abstract

Can a small set of rules help a newly formed mob to build trust quickly? Can the same mob then transition to more relaxed mobbing practices, turning up flow and collaboration?

In this session we will start to find out:
- After a small introduction
- We form one or two mobs, choose an exercise and a programming language
- Our style of working is fixed for the first round of mobbing (about 15 minutes)
- After the first round the teams evolve by running quick retrospectives and continuing to collaborate as a mob (for up to 90 minutes)
- We finish the session by sharing our experiences and learnings

Our hypothesis for this format is: When we actively focus on building trust first we are rewarded with whole team collaboration, learning and performance.

Paraphrasing Woody Zuill: Let's "turn up the good" and create an environment where everybody can excel.

Looking forward to seeing you!


Organizational notes:
This is an intentionally short session designed to fit into your busy day. Which implies we will try to start on time.
To participate you need nothing more than an internet connection and the ability to join a zoom call (install the standalone client in advance). We prefer to use cameras, so let's wear pants... :-)


# Rounds, Roles and Rotation

- Mob programming roles are 1 driver, 1 navigator, N mobbers
- Switch roles every 4 minutes
- Do a small retro after every round

# Essentials

- **Be kind** - your job is to make your teammates awesome
- **Turn up the good** - do small retros often

# Round 1 Objective: Build trust

- Strong style navigation
    - Driver:
        - You are the smart input device for the navigator
        - Actively ask navigator for help and clarifications
    - Navigator:
        - Communicate your intent
        - Tell driver what to do
        - Actively ask team for help
        - Continue an idea in play rather than starting your own
    - Mobbers:
        - Stay silent until actively asked by navigator (you can always celebrate moments of excellence)

- Intentional empathy towards the navigator
    - Mobbers and driver listen closely to the navigator and practice empathy
    - Stay aware of the navigator's intention and situation
    - Be ready to continue the navigator's intention when you become the navigator

- Strict TDD
    - Coding happens in explicit red-green-refactor cycles
    - Navigator calls out every transition to a new phase and the phase's goal

- Bonus: Celebrate moments of excellence!


# Round 1 Retrospective

## Rate yourself

- Rate yourself on the three aspects below. For each of them
    - Read description to your team
    - Everybody gives their rating from 0-5 by holding up one hand
        - 0: This didn't even happen
        - 5: I could not be happier how well we did this 
    - Write down the ratings of all team members

1. We applied strong style navigation
    - navigators had the space to navigate and ask questions
    - navigators communicated their intent and kept everyone informed
    - drivers executed on what the navigators told them
    - mobbers did not interrupt navigators unless asked
    => we experienced orderly collaboration

    List your team members' ratings here: 

2. We practiced empathy
    - by closely listening to the navigators we got to know their intentions and way of working
    - navigators felt supported by the team's willingness to give them space and being supportive when asked for help

    List your team members' ratings here: 

3. We used strict TDD
    - We worked in red-green-refactor cycles
    - Navigators called out the three phases and their purpose

    List your team members' ratings here: 


## What do you want more of? Check these hints related to round 1

- Do you want more ... ? (Doubling down on the rules of round 1)
    - Structure -> Continue to train strong style navigation or remove impediments that have caused chaos
    - TDD -> explain/discuss the method if necessary, call out phases and their purpose, keep on practicing in the next round
    - Empathy / Kindness -> Listen more closely, emphasize supporting others and their ideas over following your own agenda

- Do you want more ... ? (Relaxing/extending the rules of round 1)
    - Open flow of ideas -> - Relax strong style navigation and allow the mobbers to freely give suggestions to the navigator
    - Celebrations -> ...
    - Music -> ???
    - Whatever you experienced so far and want more of...

## Run a Micro Retro to decide what to focus on 

I learned this retro format from Fred Zuill during a remote mob session. It turned out to be quick, very effective and leave us with a log of our team learnings.

Everybody shares two things:
1. How I feel
2. One thing I want more of ("Turn up the good")

- Every time someone shares a thing to turn up, write it into your Micro Retro text file
- Things that already have been mentioned get a '*' in front of them
- Keep list ordered by number of '*'
- Add to this file in every following Micro Retro

Example:

    Micro Retro
    
    **** Continuing the intention of the previous navigator
    ** Test first / TDD
    ** Progress as working code
    The group is nice to each other

Keep this file for our big retrospective later, these are your team's most important learnings.


# From here on: Keep turning up the good  

From here on you as a team decide how you want to work and what you want to focus on. You might want to keep the mantra in mind: Trust over performance.

## Round of Mobbing

Enjoy collaboration and progress.   

## Micro Retro

Run a quick Micro Retro after each round of mobbing. **"Turn up the good"**

## Repeat
