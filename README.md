# Flash Mob Programming - Trust over Performance

A mob programming format, aimed towards creating trust quickly in a newly formed mob.


# Guiding Questions

Is there a small set of rules that helps a newly formed mob to build trust quickly?

Can the same mob then transition to more relaxed mobbing practices, improving flow of progress and learning?

Can we do this within a short session?

Can we do this with a large number of mobs?


# Meetup Session Abstract

TBD

# Rounds, Roles and Rotation

- Mob programming roles are 1 driver, 1 navigator, N mobbers
- Switch roles every 4 minutes
- Do a small retro after every round

# Essentials

- **Be kind** - your job is to make your teammates awesome
- **Turn up the good** - do small retros often

# Round 1 Objective: Build trust

- Strong style navigation
    - Driver:
        - You are the smart input device for the navigator
        - Actively ask navigator for help and clarifications
    - Navigator:
        - Communicate your intent
        - Tell driver what to do
        - Actively ask team for help
        - Continue an idea in play rather than starting your own
    - Mobbers:
        - Stay silent until actively asked by navigator (you can always celebrate moments of excellence)

- Intentional empathy towards the navigator
    - Mobbers and driver listen closely to the navigator and practice empathy
    - Stay aware of the navigator's intention and situation
    - Be ready to continue the navigator's intention when you become the navigator

- Strict TDD
    - Coding happens in explicit red-green-refactor cycles
    - Navigator calls out every transition to a new phase and the phase's goal

- Bonus: Celebrate moments of excellence!

# Round 1 Retrospective

## Rate yourself

- Rate yourself on the three aspects below. For each of them
    - Read description to your team
    - Everybody gives their rating from 0-5 by holding up one hand
        - 0: This didn't even happen
        - 5: I could not be happier how well we did this 
    - Write down the ratings of all team members

1. We applied strong style navigation
    - navigators had the space to navigate and ask questions
    - navigators communicated their intent and kept everyone informed
    - drivers executed on what the navigators told them
    - mobbers did not interrupt navigators unless asked
    => we experienced orderly collaboration

    List your team members' ratings here: 

2. We practiced empathy
    - by closely listening to the navigators we got to know their intentions and way of working
    - navigators felt supported by the team's willingness to give them space and being supportive when asked for help

    List your team members' ratings here: 

3. We used strict TDD
    - We worked in red-green-refactor cycles
    - Navigators called out the three phases and their purpose

    List your team members' ratings here: 


## What do you want more of? Check these hints related to round 1

- Do you want more ... ? (Doubling down on the rules of round 1)
    - Structure -> Continue to train strong style navigation or remove impediments that have caused chaos
    - TDD -> explain/discuss the method if necessary, call out phases and their purpose, keep on practicing in the next round
    - Empathy / Kindness -> Listen more closely, emphasize supporting others and their ideas over following your own agenda

- Do you want more ... ? (Relaxing/extending the rules of round 1)
    - Open flow of ideas -> - Relax strong style navigation and allow the mobbers to freely give suggestions to the navigator
    - Celebrations -> ...
    - Music -> ???
    - Whatever you experienced so far and want more of...

## Run a Micro Retro (as introduced by Fred Zuill) to decide what to focus on 

Everybody shares two things:
1. How I feel
2. One thing I want more of ("Turn up the good")

- Every time someone shares a thing to turn up, write it into your Micro Retro text file
- Things that already have been mentioned get a '*' in front of them
- Keep list ordered by number of '*'

Example:

    Micro Retro
    
    **** Continuing the intention of the previous navigator
    ** Test first / TDD
    ** Progress as working code
    The group is nice to each other

Keep this file for our big retrospective later, these are your team's most important learnings.


# Rounds 2 - N Objective: Improve and learn, value trust over performance 

From here on you as a team decide how you want to work and what you want to focus on.

Just one tip: Keep the quick retrospective after each round of mobbing.
